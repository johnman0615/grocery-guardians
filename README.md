# Grocery Guardian

## Description

This user-friendly budget tracker tool was created to simplify meal planning and budgetting. This will help users to stay on budget, avoid overspending, and make smarter choices when planning for their weekly and/or monthly groceries. Whether you're a seasoned budgeter or just starting to watch your spending, this app makes it simple to stay on top of your grocery bills.

## The Framework

Our team began by establishing a clear understanding of the projectâ€™s goals and visual layout. Once we aligned on the core concept, we delegated tasks to individuals, while maintaining collaborative oversight throughout the process.

We began with HTML to structure the basic framework of our project. Next, we integrated JavaScript to add functionality, ensuring proper connection between the HTML and JavaScript files. Concurrently, we linked the project to Bootstrap for responsive design elements.

To enhance the visual appeal, we developed a CSS stylesheet, fine-tuning the aesthetics and user experience. After incorporating final adjustments, we successfully completed the project.

In the end, the user can do the following to the webpage and it will respond as follows:

    1. Users can add items to the list with an optional price field.
    2. Users can edit or delete items from the list as needed.
    3. Users can mark items as purchased, moving them to a separate section.
    4. If prices are added, the app automatically calculates and displays the total cost of the list in real time.
    5. The grocery list persists between sessions using local storage.
    6. The app features a responsive design, ensuring ease of use on mobile devices for in-store shopping.
